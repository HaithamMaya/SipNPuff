# SipNPuff
## A sip-and-puff controlled mobile game for quadriplegics.

This is a demonstration for how simple mobile games and applications can be developed for quadrplegics and others who rely on a sip-and-puff controlled devices in their everyday life.

Steps:
 * Connect an analog pressure sensor to the corresponding pins on an arduino.
 * Attach a straw or tube to the pressure sensor.
 * Run the code in the Arduino folder on the arduino.
 * Install the iOS app on a phone or tablet.
 * Sip and Puff on the tube or straw to control the player in the game.
    * To turn left or right, you sip or puff, respectively, with very light air pressure.
    * To move backwards or forwards, you sip or puff, respectively, with moderate to hard air pressure.
